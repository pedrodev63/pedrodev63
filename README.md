ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pedro Kussy, fullstack web developer.

I have a passion for programming, automation, artificial intelligence. I love to study and learn new technologies and discover other ways to make things work.
 I love solving everyday problems using computational resources.

I have been a developer for over 5 years.

I have experience in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript development.

I have little experience in Java for the web because, when I started studying Java for the web at the same time, I met the NodeJs that won my heart ...

I've worked with Php.

I hope to learn Python brevement and Julia.

I currently work with JavaScript, using and exploring the entire NodeJs ecosystem. I use ReactJs, NextJs, to create front-end's and give the user a unique user experience.

I speak and write fluently Portuguese and French.

I can understand the basics of English. And I understand Spanish if the person speaks slowly.

ðŸ“« I am Angolan and I am in Angola. If you want to talk to me or exchange an idea, these are my contacts:
